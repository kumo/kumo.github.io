oops&#8230; something has gone wrong&#8230;

My switch from custom html (hand-crufted for NetPositive, Opera 3.x, Netscape 4, <span class="caps">IE 5</span>, lynx/links, etc.) to using pre-made software is not going well. Pages are missing, incomplete, and messed up. The hiragana/katakana stuff has just refused to work again.

Only time will tell what happens&#8230;
