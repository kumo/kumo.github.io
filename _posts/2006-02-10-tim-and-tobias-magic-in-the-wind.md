![Tim and Tobias](/assets/tim_and_tobias.jpg)

I remember reading a book when I was in Infant/Junior School but all I could recall were certain elements: a boy living by a canal with his uncle or aunt, a key that was a black cat, a mountain, and a kitten being thrown in the canal.

I searched and I searched and I found a forum with someone looking for the same thing as me, but they were told that it was perhaps "Magic Mountain".

Somehow though, I managed to find the book and so I place this information in the google archives just in case someone else is searching for it

The author was Sheila K. McCullagh and the first book was called **Tim and Tobias ~ Magic in the Wind**. I also discovered a website called "Tim and the Hidden People" (which is where I probably found this missing book) and can be found at [www.timandthehiddenpeople.moonfruit.com](http://www.timandthehiddenpeople.moonfruit.com)
