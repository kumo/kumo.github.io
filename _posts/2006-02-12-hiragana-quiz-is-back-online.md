I used to have some php scripts for learning hiragana and katakana but they stopped working when I changed servers. I took the change to begin rewriting them (in ruby on rails) and finally I have the first version of the hiragana quiz online. It is still basically the same as the old version but at least the code is much cleaner and I should be able to add new features without too much trouble.

Anyway, the new hiragana quiz can be found [here](http://quiz.kumo.it/hiragana).

Good luck!

**UPDATE:** The dns problems seem to have been resolved so the quiz is back online again!
