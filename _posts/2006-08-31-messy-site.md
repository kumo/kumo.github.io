Well something seems to have happened in the past couple of days or perhaps it has been weeks and I never noticed. For now I am reverting to a wordpress version, but surely something doesnâ€™t work.

It is quite troublesome and makes me wonder if I should just hand-cruft some html again but those would be dangerous waters indeed...
