I am happy to see that [TheRubyMine](http://therubymine.com) is online and so if you are interested in the Italian Ruby and Ruby on Rails community then you should take a look and perhaps even take part.

It is still early days for them but give them some time and I am sure they will start causing troubleâ€¦ hmm I hope it won't be long before I join in with the fun!
