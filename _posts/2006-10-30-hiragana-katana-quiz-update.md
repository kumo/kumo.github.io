I have updated the hiragana and katakana quizes and I hope they are now easier to use.

I have split the text box on the question page into multiple text boxes so that there is one for each hiragana or katakana. I hope that this is clearer than the previous version where one had to insert a space between each romanji.

The _results page_ might actually be useful now as it shows you not only how many times you got a katakana or hiragana correct, but also how many times you got the row of characters (e.g. the â€˜k' row with ka, ki, ku, ke, ko) right so you can decide to reconfigure the quiz and choose some different rows.

As always, the quizes can be found at [quiz.kumo.it](http://quiz.kumo.it) so enjoy! If there are any problems, or you don't like how I have changed something, or you have new ideas please write to me on my guestbook or at [kumo@kumo.it](mailto:kumo@kumo.it).
