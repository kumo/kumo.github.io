Well, I upgraded to wordpress 2.1 and I thought everything was fine, but as I forgot to copy over some files many of the pages stopped working :( I suppose I should really try and check for such things in the future! Well, I have a couple of changes coming up, so I'll cross my fingers and hope that I get them working...
