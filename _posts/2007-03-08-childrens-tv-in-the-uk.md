This is more of a note to myself, but when I was a lad at lot of the children's drama that was shown on childrens tv was Australian or from New Zealand. Thinking back it was quite impressive as there was (as far as I can remember):

- [The Girl From Tomorrow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_from_Tomorrow)
- [Mirror, Mirror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror%2C_Mirror_%28TV_series%29)
- [Round the Twist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_The_Twist)

(all links point to wikipedia)

Does anyone remember anything else?
