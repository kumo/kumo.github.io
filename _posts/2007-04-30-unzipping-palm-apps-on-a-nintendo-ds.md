Yesterday we wanted to play 3D tictactoe on my palm, but we didn't have any such game. Now I could have used [OnBoardC](http://web.archive.org/web/20070619040851/http://onboardc.sourceforge.net/) or [plua](http://web.archive.org/web/20070619040851/http://groups.yahoo.com/group/plua/) to ‘quickly' write a game but I didn't have 2 weeks or a collection of icons at hand. Instead I found myself using Opera on my Nintendo DS to browse the internet but I couldn't download the zip file.

So, rebooting into [DSLinux](http://web.archive.org/web/20070619040851/http://dslinux.org/) (using a supercard and sd card) I could use wget to download file to the memory card and then unzip it.

All I needed to do then was put the memory card in the palm and copy it … after playing the game I wished that I could write the game for the Nintendo DS.
