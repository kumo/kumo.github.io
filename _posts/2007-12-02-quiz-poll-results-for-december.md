I think it is now time to discuss the quiz poll results. Thank you everyone who spent some time voting and especially those that left comments. The current results can be seen in the graph below:

The comments that I received were as follows:

- ...should show results at end of quiz...
- ...ask real words...
- ...optional real words...
- ...keyboard shortcuts...
- ...show correct answers at end of quiz...

Some notes from the graph and comments:

- more than half of you requested that you be tested with real words;
- repetitive questions appears to be a problem;
- an equal number of you wanted to be able to check your progress and also have the questions adapting automatically to your progress.

*Real words* I believe have been requested by people that have already learnt quite a bit of the hiragana or katakana and now want to be tested on words that are actually useful. When I try to learn things I tend to focus on one group at a time so I think it would be difficult to find a list of words that only contain ka, ki, ku, ke, ko for example.

*Repetitive questions* could either be the result of selecting too few character groups so that the questions are always formed from the same 10 characters, or instead the same characters are shown regardless of how many character groups are selected.

*Progress tracking* and *automatically adapting questions* can allow the software to automatically suggest which groups/characters need testing and when. However, if the on-screen results are not clear then there is the risk that the users are not aware of their progress and perhaps even the mistakes they have made and need to concentrate on.

I will post on this again later, but if people do have any more comments or want to open up a discussion then please use the comment form below.
