I do think that it is about time that I changed the theme of this website. I don't know if anyone remembers the original hand-crufted theme but luckily archive.org is able to help me out:

![[kumo.it] website in June 2002](/assets/kumoit-20071202.png)

The main problem that I have with the current design is the list of pages that is just too long and distracting. I know that I could use some sort of list folding plugin, but I was hoping that there was a better alternative—perhaps even a redesign of the website rather than just choosing a different theme.

Important features are:

- News/blog posts
- Static pages with subpages—-I might have posts that talk about BeOS software, but there is a specific page for each piece of software
- Flickr photos!
- Spam plugin—-I hardly get any comments any more, but akismet has blocked over 45,000 spam
