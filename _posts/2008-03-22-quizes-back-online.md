_UPDATE: well the old quiz should be back online so if there are any problems please let me know! I am going to start documenting my work on the new version of the quizes so let’s see how it goes._

Hello, I am sorry to say that I am putting the quizes **temporarily** offline. The reason being that they are in definite need of changes and I haven’t updated the code for a long time; mainly because it was too awkward deploying new versions. I am starting to take the steps to simplify the whole process, but it may take a couple of days to return.

As I want to go to Japan this summer I think this will be a good opportunity for me to sort out the quizes and make them more useful for me which in turn should be more useful for you!
