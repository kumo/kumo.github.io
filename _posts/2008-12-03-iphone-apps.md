I have released a couple of iPhone/iPod Touch apps recently but have yet to create a space for them on this website. It has been an interesting experience developing for the platform even if I haven’t quite go my head around Objective-C. It certainly isn’t the same as programming for BeOS or Ruby on Rails (or C# & .net) but it is a decent language.

If anyone has any suggestions then please feel free to contact me at [kumo@kumo.it](mailto:kumo@kumo.it) with any ideas. Also I am looking for translations for my [Roman Numerals](http://ax.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=291773125&mt=8) application (external link to itunes) so if anyone would like to help out I would be most grateful. I have Italian, Korean, and Chinese (Traditional and Simplified) so far.
