Update: this version is now available. See this post for more details.

As promised, I am working on a new version of Roman Numerals. My main aims for this version are:

- support for large numbers;
- easy cleaning of inputted year.

There are multiple ways of writing larger numbers and I hope to be able to incorporate these into the future versions of the Roman Numerals program. For now I am focusing on the use of brackets (they are the letter C and the reverse letter C) to multiply the numbers, so that (I) is equivalent to 1,000, ((I)) is equivalent to 10,000, I)) is equivalent to 5,000, etc.

The following screenshots show some examples of these:
