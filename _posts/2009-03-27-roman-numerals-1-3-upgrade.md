The latest version of Roman Numerals has been approved and should be available on the app store. This version adds a must requested method for clearing the inputted numbers in one go and extends the Arabic to Roman numerals converter to generate larger numbers in an archaic format, for example, 1661 can be represented as (I) I) CLXI.

To use this new format just select the 2002 -> MMII tab and press the bottom left button with the ((I)) I)) symbol.
