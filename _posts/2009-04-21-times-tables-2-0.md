After a couple of months of development the new version of Times Tables for the iPhone and iPod Touch is now available in the app store. This version contains a lot of changes and new additions and has things that will be of interest to children and also to parents.

For the children there are highscores, sound effects, quick quizes, and perhaps more importantly a competition mode. For the parents there are multiple levels of difficulty for each of the tables, progression tracking of the tables and questions, and there are different types of quizes that provide timed and non-timed tests.

For more information see the Times Tables page here.
