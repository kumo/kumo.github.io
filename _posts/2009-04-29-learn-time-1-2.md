In the following video you can see some of the new features of LearnTime. There is a new mode called "free play" that allows the child to play with the clock and see what time it is. I have also tried to make the program more appealing by adding sounds and animations on the game menus. I have a couple more things that I would like to add but I will add these in hopefully the next version. I do plan on adding another couple of themes so if you have any requests please contact me at kumo@kumo.it.

As always there is a demo version of LearnTime (LearnTime Lite) that allows you to try out the first two levels (essentially the hours and 15 minute intervals) and this is also available on the app store.
