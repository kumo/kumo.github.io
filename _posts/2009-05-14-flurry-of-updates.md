This post is a bit late, but quite a few of my iPhone programs have been updated in the past week or so. Times Tables, Learn Time, Learn Time Lite, and Roman Quiz have all received a number of fixes and improvements.

My favourite change is the animated menu that I added to Learn Time and Learn Time Lite. The user is still presented with a table view from which they choose the starting level, but there is an animated fish swimming from side to side.

I will be releasing a new version of Times Tables soon that will allow the highscores and unlocked tables to be reset â€” useful if you are trying out the program and want to delete your highscores before giving it to your children.
