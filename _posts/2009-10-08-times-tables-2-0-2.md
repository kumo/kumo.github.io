A new version of TimesTables has been approved by the app store and should be available shortly. In this update it is possible to reset the high scores and the unlocked tables. To do this you must go into Settings and choose either “Reset unlocked tables” or “Reset highscores”.

In case you weren’t aware in the Settings you can choose whether the questions appear as 7×1=7 or 1×7=7 so that you can match how your child studies them in school.
