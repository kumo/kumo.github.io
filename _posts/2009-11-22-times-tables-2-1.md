TimesTables 2.1 has been approved by the app store and should now be available. This version adds 11x and 12x questions to each of the tables and also tries to simplify the way that information is shown so that is understandable even if the child cannot read yet.

The 11x and 12x questions are not enabled by default and this must be performed by using the Settings program and selected the 11x and 12x option.

I have also added a page on [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/TimesTablesapp/181938144661) and on [uservoice](http://timestablesapp.uservoice.com/pages/33094-general) where you can submit requests or vote on existing ideas.
