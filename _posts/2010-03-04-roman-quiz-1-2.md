An update to Roman Quiz is now available in the app store. In this version the quiz mode has been revamped to make the experience more interesting. The custom quiz mode has been replaced by four specific quizzes that test the various types of Roman Numerals. Each quiz starts off in Easy mode, and then in the following 3 modes each quiz is timed with the time available reducing in each level!

I have more plans for Roman Quiz so update to this version and let me know what you think.
