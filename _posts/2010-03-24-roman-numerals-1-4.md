Roman Numerals has been updated to 1.4. The main feature of this version is copy & paste. With this you can, for example, convert a roman numeral, copy the conversion and paste it in email, or copy a roman numeral from a webpage and paste it directly into the app without having to type it out.

You need to have upgraded to at least iPhone OS 3.0 (on either an iPhone or iPod Touch) to use this update, because copy and paste doesn't work with previous versions of the iPhone OS.
