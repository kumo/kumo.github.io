A new update to TimesTables should be available in the appstore. This version is a minor update that allows the question presentation to be mixed up. Previously there was the option to decide how to present the questions because in different countries the times tables are shown differently, for example:

> 1×7, 2×7, 3×7, 4×7, 5×7, ...

> 7×1, 7×2, 7×3, 7×4, 7×5, ...

Now, on the configuration page, there is the option to mix these up so that the questions can appear in either way. Sometimes it is easy to learn that 2 times 5 is 10, but what is 5 times 2?!
