Well it has been a while but the source code to my BeOS projects seems to have reappeared. I don't know how complete they are (I didn't use version control in 2000-2002) and whether they compile or not, so I am trying them out. I have BeOS working in a QEMU emulator (well just â€˜Q' actually) but without network or colour. Trying to download haiku r1 alpha 1 to see how that goes instead. I will be posting updates to a separate tumblelog at [http://kumo-beos.tumblr.com/](http://kumo-beos.tumblr.com/). I don't suppose there is a version control that works with bfs attributes is there? I would like to stick the code on github, but that would just strip away the all-important attributes, so not very useful!
