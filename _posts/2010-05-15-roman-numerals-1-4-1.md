I am working on an improved version of Roman Numerals with more conversion options and possibly an iPad version, however I wanted to focus on some of the issues that people have been having. This small update adds auto-repeat to the delete button so that it is easier to clear MCMXXVII from the screen instead of shaking your iPhone or iPod Touch.
