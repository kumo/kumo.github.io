The TimesTables iPhone app has been recently updated to 2.3.3. The main two features in this version are that it will automatically start the app with the last player, and it will also show the last quiz that was played so that it can be played again easily. If you have downloaded 2.3.2 then you will need to download 2.3.3 because this fixes a bug where the highscores were no longer selectable.
