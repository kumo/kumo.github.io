I have been working on some plugins for the rather nice [Sketch app](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/). The plugins themselves don't do anything particularly special, but I wanted an easy way of being able to create particular images.

The plugins (and sourcecode) are on [GitHub](https://github.com/kumo/Sketch-Plugin-Scripts) and there you will find instructions on how to use them.

## Randomly placed plugin

I made the plugins because I needed two things: firstly I needed to fill an artboard with copies of an object, and I wanted them to be randomly placed and randomly rotated.

## Marching plugin

Secondly, I wanted to clone an object into a group that looked like they were marching/walking. This is different to the `Make Grid...` feature, because alternate rows are offset.
