> *cloudpebbles* is dead. Long live *cadigatt*

I have been wanting to rename the cloudpebbles website for a while. I have always liked the name and it has been around for quite a few years now, but at this point it is just a bit too similar to another website[^cp] and is easily misplaced. So, at this point, my other website is going to be [cadigatt.com](http://www.cadigatt.com) and it will contain everything that was on cloudpebbles.com.

[^cp]: cloudpebble.net -- the rather interesting online development tool for the Pebble watch
