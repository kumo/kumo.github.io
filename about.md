This website has served many purposes since its first version in 2002. For quite a while it contained information about my BeOS software which can still be found on [BeBits](http://www.bebits.com/devprofile/260) together with some thoughts on [kumo-beos.tumblr.com](http://kumo-beos.tumblr.com). Then after lying abandoned for a while, it contained information about my iOS software, but those can now be found on [cloudpebbles.com](http://www.cloudpebbles.com).

I am a developer and a teacher, from Birmingham, UK that lives in Italy, so these pages might contain something useful in the future, but for now it is probably easier just to follow my twitter account [@kumo](http://twitter.com/kumo).
